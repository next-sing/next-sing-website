      I joined Next Sing because I had zero former singing experience and
      didn’t want to seriously play the piano in college. I thought singing
      was fun (and I wasn’t 100% terrible at it) and singing with instruments
      is even better! So yeah I guess it worked out!

      Cynthia roped me into this, but I *do* like singing so it wasn't hard
      for her. I also like playing video games and doing computery stuff and
      buildy/designy course 2 stuff. :P

      Hi! I’m Cynthia. I’m the person who thought of Next Sing while eating
      dinner in the stud. So if you think anything about Next Sing just reeks
      of mediocre fast-casual food, you can blame me.

      A native of South Texas, Natasha has performed with many student groups
      at MIT, mostly in theater. She was very pleased to branch out into
      acapella when Next Sing was founded, and surprised at how often she is
      asked to fake being a soprano. She also enjoys dance, late-night
      discussions with her neighbors, and the fascinating possibilities of
      biological engineering.
