      I joined Next Sing because I had zero former singing experience and didn’t want to seriously play the piano in
      college. I thought singing was fun (and I wasn’t 100% terrible at it) and singing with instruments is even
      better! So yeah I guess it worked out!

      Hi! I’m Cynthia. I’m the person who thought of Next Sing while eating dinner in the stud. So if you think
      anything about Next Sing just reeks of mediocre fast-casual food, you can blame me

      A native of South Texas, Natasha has performed with many student groups at MIT, mostly in theater. She was very
      pleased to branch out into acapella when Next Sing was founded, and surprised at how often she is asked to fake
      being a soprano. She also enjoys dance, late-night discussions with her neighbors, and the fascinating
      possibilities of biological engineering.
