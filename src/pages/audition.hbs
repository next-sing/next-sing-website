					<h2>Audition Info</h2>
					<h3>Sign up to audition here!</h3>
					<p>Auditions will be separated into instrumental and vocal auditions. Vocal auditions will be held at DATE(S) between TIME1 AND TIME2 in PLACE(S). Instrumental auditions will be held at DATE2(S) between TIME3 AND TIME4 in PLACE2(S). <b>Note that these are the audition dates and places regardless of which acts you are interested in</b></p>

					<p><b>What to prepare for each type of audition</b>: for vocal auditions, please prepare a verse and a chorus (roughly 90 seconds) of any song. For <i>piano, guitar, and drums instrumental auditions only</i>, your audition will consist of sightreading. A piano and drumkit will be available in your audition room. You do <i>not</i> need to prepare a piece. For any other instrument that has pitch (e.g. not maracas, etc.), please prepare 90 seconds of any piece.</p>

					<p>The audition form closes at 48 hrs before the earliest audition time and date. You will be assigned audition time(s), which will be emailed to you, within 24 hours of the form close. If you cannot make your assigned audition time(s), please contact us as soon as possible. We will either reassign you to different time slots or try to arrange an alternative audition. Due to time and availability constraints, it may be impossible for us to arrange an alternative audition for everyone who reqeusts one.</p>
